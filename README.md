## Tweet app

This project is a simple twitter style application, developed using my [mvc framework](https://github.com/Jordan-Bianco/mvc_framework).<br>
A user can register on the site and, after verifying their account, start posting their tweets, visit other users' profiles, comment on other tweets and add or remove likes. <br>
In the user's dashboard, the user can change their profile information, change their password or delete their account.
